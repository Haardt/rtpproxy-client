#summary RTPProxy server protocol
#labels Development,Documentation

The available RTPProxy server commands are listed in http://www.b2bua.org/wiki/RTPproxy/Protocol but command and response format details are missing. So this document describes what we figured out from source code analysis and tests.


= Command Format =

The general command format is:

{{{
COOKIE COMMAND ARGUMENTS
}}}

 * _COOKIE_ is an arbitrary string identifying the the command. The response for that command will have the same prefix.

 * _COMMAND_ and _ARGUMENTS_ are those described in the [http://www.b2bua.org/wiki/RTPproxy/Protocol RTPProxy Protocol documentation].
